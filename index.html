                    <p>Bernard Hoffman, indisputably the world's most powerful man, holds a terrible secret. It began
                        during his extensive military service, when his team ran a mission to Kayadir in 2006. Some of
                        you may be familiar with this particular mission, where he came out of a massacre as the sole
                        survivor... but that seems to be <i>all</i> we're allowed to know.</p>
                    <p>Following the incident, all records of the mission were sealed. There was no freedom of
                        information allowed, no leaks, not even a shred of the all-too redacted documents. But the ink
                        ran off the page like the truth ran from those who would shield it from the public.</p>
                    <p>What we know now is that Hoffman's militech empire didn't only spring out of nowhere, but he has
                        been funded all this time by the very same government that had sent him out to Kayadir--not to
                        root out terrorists, but to test their latest project. A super soldier project. How else do you
                        explain his perfect health on return, his immediate discharge, and the funds to create a
                        sprawling tech dynasty that's somehow managed to change the entire world?</p>
                    <p>Not only that, but his sudden disinterest in all of it. He runs all of this from abroad, texting
                        into meetings and rarely making public appearances these days. Clearly, he is hiding his altered
                        state from those who would know best, and using this sudden interest in "archaeology" as a cover
                        to disappear.</p>
